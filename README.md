# Rinon

An emoji server bot for some friends and I. ðŸŽ‰

# Installation and stuff

## Config file

Rename the `config.example.js` file to `config.js` and fill out the necessary fields. Almost all of the fields will have preset values, but there are some that will need to fill out yourself.

## Required permissions

* `ADD_REACTIONS`: For adding reactions so that the emojis can be approved or denied.
* `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE`: For the `>server` command, so that users may join other emoji servers that Rinon is on.
* `EMBED_LINKS`: To post embeds in the #emoji-voting channel (text fallback soonâ„¢(?)), and also for the `>server` command (text fallback availableâ„¢).
* `MANAGE_CHANNELS`: For creating the #emoji-voting channel with the correct permissions.
* `MANAGE_EMOJIS`: For adding new emojis.
* `MANAGE_MESSAGES`: For clearing reactions on approved/denied emojis.

## Initialization

Invite Rinon to your server and run the `>init` command. This should set up the #emoji-voting properly. After that, use the `>request` command and you're good to go!
